# Video-Processing-with-Cotton-Effect-Using-OpenCV-and-MoviePy
This Python script processes a video to apply a "cotton effect," which gives a soft, pastel-like appearance. It uses OpenCV for frame manipulation and MoviePy for video handling. The effect includes smoothing, edge detection, and combining color and edges for a cartoonish look. Each frame is processed and saved to a new output video.
