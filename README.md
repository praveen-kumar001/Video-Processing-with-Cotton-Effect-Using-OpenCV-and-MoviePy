Here’s a `README.md` format for your video processing project that applies a cotton effect using OpenCV and MoviePy:

```md
# Cotton Effect Video Processor

This project applies a "cotton effect" to videos, creating a soft, pastel-like appearance. The effect is achieved using OpenCV for image processing and MoviePy for video manipulation.

## Features

- Applies a cotton effect to each frame of the video.
- Maintains video quality while transforming the visual style.
- Simple interface for specifying input and output video paths.

## Technologies

- **Python**: The programming language used for this project.
- **OpenCV**: A library for computer vision that provides image processing functions.
- **MoviePy**: A library for video editing that allows manipulation of video files.

## File Structure

```
.
├── cotton_effect.py  # Main script for applying the cotton effect
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python moviepy numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Open `cotton_effect.py`.
2. Set the paths for the input and output videos:
   ```python
   input_video = "path/to/your/input/video.mp4"   # Input video path
   output_video = "path/to/save/processed/video.mp4"  # Output video path
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python cotton_effect.py
   ```

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the script:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_video = "/path/to/your/input/video.mp4"
    output_video = "/path/to/save/processed/video.mp4"
    process_video(input_video, output_video)
```

Feel free to customize the input and output paths to fit your needs!
